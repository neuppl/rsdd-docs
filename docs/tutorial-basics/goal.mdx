# Goal: Model Counting

In 10 minutes, we'll cover most of RSDD's basic functionality.

## End Product

By the end of this tutorial, you'll develop a CLI application written Rust that performs model counting on CNFs.

Throughout the process, you'll explore various areas of RSDD:

- knowledge representations (BDDs, SDDs)
- compilation strategies (bottom-up, compression versus semantic)
- operations performable on decision diagrams
- various data interchange formats (importing from DIMACS CNF, serializing to JSON)

More concretely, we'll make a CLI tool that can take arbitrary CNFs (in DIMACS form) and perform a model count for them. We will support two different knowledge representations + compilation strategies --- bottom-up with BDDs and SDDs --- and show how to serialize these structures for reuse.

```
$ ./rsdd-test -f example.cnf
model count: 5
```
