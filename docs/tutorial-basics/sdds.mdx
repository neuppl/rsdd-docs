# SDDs and VTrees

Learn how to use Sentential Decision Diagrams and create a corresponding VTree.

## Concept: Sentential Decision Diagrams

We'll now explore a different knowledge representation: Sentential Decision Diagrams (SDDs). SDDs were first introduced by the [Automated Reasoning Group](http://reasoning.cs.ucla.edu/sdd/) at UCLA, specifically in ["SDD: A New Canonical Representation of Propositional Knowledge Bases." (Darwiche, 2011)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/2283516.2283536). In summary, they are a relaxation on some of the properties of ROBDDs.

ROBDDs require a variable ordering for their canonicity property. SDDs have an equivalent datastructure, called a "vtree".

### How do SDDs work?

### How do vtrees work?

This section is coming soon!

## Picking a `VTree`

RSDD has support for basic vtree types (such as "right-linear", which picks the variables in-order and always has the left child as a variable), as well as heuristics to pick a good vtree for a target CNF.

Let's write a new `compile_as_sdd` function; similar to the BDD version, we'll first pick a vtree before generating the SDD. For simplicity's sake, we'll compare a right-linear vtree (identical to a BDD), and a left-linear vtree (very unoptimal, often considered the "worst-case").

```rust title="src/main.rs"
use rsdd::repr::{vtree::VTree, var_label::VarLabel};

fn compile_as_sdd(cnf: &Cnf) {
    let order: Vec<VarLabel> = (0..cnf.num_vars())
        .map(|x| VarLabel::new(x as u64))
        .collect();

    let rl_vtree = VTree::right_linear(&order);
    let ll_vtree = VTree::left_linear(&order);
}
```

As we'll see in the next section, the choice of vtree matters quite a bit!

## Creating an `SddPtr` with a `SddManager`

Similar to the BDD case, we will use a builder to do most of the work in generating SDDs and applying operations on them. In particular, the trait for `SddPtr`s is the `SddBuilder`.

The `CompressionSddManager` is the "default" implementation for the `SddBuilder` trait; it preserves canonicity of SDDs via "compression", a concept introduced in Darwiche's 2011 paper. Using the manager is very straightforward:

```rust title="src/main.rs"
use rsdd::{sdd_builder::{CompressionSddManager, SddBuilder}};

fn compile_as_sdd_with_vtree(cnf: &Cnf, vtree: VTree) {
    let man = CompressionSddManager::new(vtree);
    let sdd = man.from_cnf(cnf);

    println!("# nodes: {}", sdd.num_child_nodes())
}
```

Now, let's use our function in `compile_as_sdd`:

```rust title="src/main.rs"
fn compile_as_sdd(cnf: &Cnf) {
    let order: Vec<VarLabel> = (0..cnf.num_vars())
        .map(|x| VarLabel::new(x as u64))
        .collect();

    let rl_vtree = VTree::right_linear(&order);
    let ll_vtree = VTree::left_linear(&order);

    compile_as_sdd_with_vtree(cnf, rl_vtree);
    compile_as_sdd_with_vtree(cnf, ll_vtree);
}
```

And finally, use it in our main function:

```rust title="src/main.rs"
fn main() {
    // ...
    compile_as_sdd(&cnf);
}
```

Observe what happens when we run our comparison:


```
$ cargo run example.cnf
# nodes: 41
# nodes: 151
```

Wow! The right-linear vtree produced a significantly smaller SDD than the left-linear one.

## Visualization: Comparing VTrees

Curious about how different vtrees affect the final SDD? Compare them side-by-side for the same CNF!
