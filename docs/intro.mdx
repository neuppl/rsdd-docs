# Introduction

RSDD (Rust Decision Diagrams) is a Rust library for manipulating decision diagrams.

This documentation site is an active work-in-progress! The [Basic Tutorial](category/tutorial-basics/) is partially complete; future sections are later on the roadmap.

If you use RSDD in your project, please site us as:

```
@misc{RSDD, 
    title = {The Rust Decision Diagram Library (RSDD)}, 
    url = {https://github.com/neuppl/rsdd}, 
    version = {pre-1.0},
    author = {Holtzen, Steven and Wang, Matthew and Gouwar, John and Stites, Sam and Cho, Minsung},
}
```

## Live Demo

Input a DIMACS-formatted CNF, and visualize the SDD generated by RSDD with various vtrees.
