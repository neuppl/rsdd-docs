# Introduction

RSDD (Rust Decision Diagrams) is a Rust library for manipulating decision diagrams.

This documentation site is an active work-in-progress! The [Basic Tutorial](category/tutorial-basics/) is partially complete; future sections are later on the roadmap.

## Live Demo

Input a DIMACS-formatted CNF, and visualize the SDD generated by RSDD with various vtrees.
